## Interview Introduction:

Good Morning/Evening I am harsha Vardhan.

sociente genrale is  blah blah balhGive 1 to 2 lines about societe generale (it should be very short less than 2 lines).
Here if possible, we should mention our current project (TODO I will add this later)
I have been working on technologies like Jenkins, Docker, K8S, Azure Pipelines, Azure cloud, Terraform. 
Currently we are using azure cloud to host our infrastructure for our project and we have adapted azure DevOps services for our Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment process. My daily activites would be creating CI/CD pipelines to automate the interagion of the source and build it, package it, and run tests and then deploy the applications into multiple environments such as Develop, test, stage and production. I also find different ways to transform and improve the existing pipeline into an automated process by using various tools scripts from a manual process. I have created different pipelines for multiple projects and also for multiple application stack such as java, nodesjs, dotnet applications. I have provisioned multiple environments and projects by using Infra structure as code (IAC) Terraform. 
Parallelly I also support developers and qa teams on addressing the issues or failure in the application level, pipeline failures infra failures by troubleshooting and identifying the root cause of the issue and then fixing it. These are my data to day activities.
